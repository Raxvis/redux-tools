# Intro

This is a small React / Redux Test to help give Distributor Central an idea of your development methods. This is by no means a pass or fail test but just something to help us get to know you better.

The app is a small TODO app.

Please feel free to ask questions of one of the developers if you have any questions or need any help.

This test is built using React, Redux, Bootstrap 4 and React Scripts.

An .eslintrc.json is provided to help you lint the code.

Chrome Extentions we recommend adding:

-   [Redux Devtools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en)
-   [React Devtools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)

# Tasks

-   Make the App function properly (there are several errors)
-   Add a checkbox to each Todo that when checked, it strikes through the task
-   Allow a Todo to be edited once it has been created

# Improvements

This is your chance to add improvements to the test. Think of it as making your mark on a piece of code. It can be anything from cleaning the syntax, removing errors / warnings, to adding features we haven't thought of or asked for.

Some suggestions if you need a little inspiration

-   Delete Todos
-   Wrap error prone code in try / catches and provide a safe recover or alert the user
-   Add sorting / drag and drop to the Todos or Lists
-   Persist the state to localStorage
